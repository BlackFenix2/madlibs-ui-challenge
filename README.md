## Thank you for accepting Flocabulary's Front End Engineer challenge!

At Flocabulary, we strive to provide rich educational materials that are also elegant, intuitive
web interfaces. In this challenge you'll help create a hypothetical
feature that's very similar to mad libs ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs ).
It won't be highly educational, but with your help, it'll at least have a good UI.

Here's a live hosted demo of this functionality: https://flocabulary.github.io/madlibs-ui-challenge/

It's functional, but it clearly needs some styling and finessing. A Flocabulary designer has provided a set of mocks for how the feature should look and feel. Those mocks can be seen here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sq946n18SD2QJTdwRXPp8Tfq_Uvrr2Zh?usp=sharing . Your task is to make the feature match the mocks. Where elements change size or color, care should be taken to smoothly transition by usage of CSS features like `transition`, `animation`.
